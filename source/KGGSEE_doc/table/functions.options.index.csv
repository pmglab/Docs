Option,Description,Examples with default value
--gene-assoc,perform gene-based association analysis,
--macg,perform Mendelian randomization analysis for causal gene estimation,
--spa,perform single cell type and phenotype association analysis,
--calcu-selectivity,calculate selective expression of gene or transcripts in a tissue or a cell type,
--ld-pruning-mr,prune a variant with genotypic correlation to another variant> the cutoff for causal gene estimation by MR,--ld-pruning-mr 0.5
--multiple-testing [bonf/benfdr/ fixed],the multiple testing method used to select significant genes for the conditional gene-based analysis. There are three settings. bonf: Standard Bonferroni correction given a family-wise error rate specified by --p-value-cutoff.  benfdr: Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate. fixed: Filtering by a fixed p-value cutoff.,--multiple-testing bonf
--p-value-cutoff,the family-wise cutoff for the multiple testing.,--p-value-cutoff 0.05
--top-gene,only select the N top significant genes for subsequent gene-based conditional analysis by ECS, --top-gene N
